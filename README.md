# Olio

iOS 15.0+ | Swift 5.5.1 | Xcode 13.1

## Summary

Olio allows you to track calisthenics-based workouts.

Start by adding exercises to your library, such as Pull Ups and Pistol Squats. Give each exercise a name and assign it to a muscle group to keep your library organised.

Build a workout from scratch or from a custom template containing your favourite exercises, then schedule it for whenever is convenient for you.

Add, delete and complete sets in a workout and watch the progress bar tick along as you move through the exercises. When you're done complete the workout and it'll be stored forever in your workout history.

Take a look at a specific exercise's history to view your performance over time and ensure you keep progressing!
